**StudySessionPlatform**

## Project Description
The **StudySessionPlatform** is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can create, join, and participate in study sessions. Sessions are hosted by individuals (the hosts), who define a topic, a start time, and a reward pool for participants. Participants can join these sessions and, upon completion, receive a share of the reward pool based on their participation.

The platform utilizes a custom ERC-20 token, **StudyToken (STDY)**, to handle rewards and transaction payments within the system. This ensures that all rewards and interactions are secure, transparent, and verifiable on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The goal of the **StudySessionPlatform** is to create an engaging and incentivized educational environment where participants are rewarded for their contribution to study sessions. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures fairness, transparency, and security in the distribution of rewards. Ultimately, the vision is to foster a global community of learners who can collaborate, share knowledge, and be rewarded for their educational efforts in a decentralized manner.

## Key Features
- **Create and Host Study Sessions**: Any user can create a study session by specifying a topic, start time, duration, and a reward pool. Hosts must transfer the reward pool in **StudyTokens** to the contract to create the session.
- **Join Study Sessions**: Users can join active study sessions before they start. Once a session starts, participants are locked in, and no new participants can join.
- **Session Completion and Reward Distribution**: After the session concludes, the host can mark the session as completed. The reward pool is then distributed among all participants based on the number of participants. The reward is proportional to the participation in the session.
- **ERC-20 Token Integration**: The platform uses an ERC-20 token (StudyToken, symbol: **STDY**) for handling payments and rewards, ensuring that users receive their rewards in a secure, trustless environment.


## Future Enhancements
- **Session Ratings & Reviews**: Introduce a system to rate and review sessions, encouraging quality content and community engagement.
- **Session Scheduling**: Enable the ability for users to schedule recurring study sessions.
- **Automated Reward Calculations**: Improve reward distribution algorithms to consider more than just participant count (e.g., session engagement).
